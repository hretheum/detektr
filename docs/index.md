# Detektor - Visual Detection & Automation System

Welcome to the Detektor documentation. Detektor is an advanced visual detection and home automation system that uses AI to analyze camera feeds and trigger intelligent actions in your smart home.

## What is Detektor?

Detektor is a comprehensive system that:

- **Captures** video streams from IP cameras
- **Detects** objects, faces, and gestures using AI models
- **Recognizes** voice commands and processes natural language
- **Automates** home devices through Home Assistant integration
- **Learns** from user interactions to improve over time

## Key Features

### üé• **Multi-Camera Support**

Process up to 8 IP camera streams simultaneously with real-time analysis.

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Detection**

- Object detection (YOLO)
- Face recognition (InsightFace)
- Gesture recognition (MediaPipe)
- Voice processing (Whisper)

### üè† **Home Assistant Integration**

Seamless integration with Home Assistant for device control and automation.

### üß† **LLM Intelligence**

Natural language processing with OpenAI/Anthropic for smart intent recognition.

### üìä **Full Observability**

Complete monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger tracing from day one.

### üîí **Security First**

Privacy-focused design with end-to-end encryption and local processing.
